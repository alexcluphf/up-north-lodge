                <p class="bold">What started as a dream between three college friends has now become a serene escape for nature lovers and adventure seekers alike. Katy King, Sandra Stone, and Jeremy Jetson met during their university years, bonding over their shared love for the great outdoors, cozy cabin retreats, and the idea of creating a place where people could unwind and reconnect with nature.</p>
                <p class="bold">After years of planning and countless road trips to find the perfect location, the trio discovered a breathtaking lakeside property surrounded by towering pines and rolling wilderness. With a passion for hospitality and an appreciation for rustic charm, Up North Lodge and Resort was born—a place where guests can experience the peace and beauty that inspired its founders from the very beginning.</p>
                <p class="bold">Whether you're here for a quiet weekend getaway or an outdoor adventure, Katy, Sandra, and Jeremy have poured their hearts into making this resort feel like home. They hope that every visitor leaves with unforgettable memories and a newfound love for the great outdoors.</p>
